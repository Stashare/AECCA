This is an Android application for checking whether a particular examinee is cleared to sit for the examination, whether the examinee has cleared the set examination fee or school fees. In short, the app takes the role of an exam card normally used in universities & colleges. Apart from clearing the examinee, it also take roll-calls during exam time. The app connects to a server to retrieve the available payment information of concerned examinees and stores the info in a local database. It is operated by a designated supervisor (user) who inputs the examineeâ€™s National ID, school ID, or any other unique identification the examinee might be given by an institution or the examination body, to search for details of the examinee. There is a future plan of adding fingerprint functionality as an input method.
